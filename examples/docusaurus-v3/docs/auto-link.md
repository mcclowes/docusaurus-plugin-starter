# Remark plugin demo

The starter ships with a tiny remark plugin that replaces any `NOTE` markers found in markdown.
It is intentionally simple – edit `src/remark/starterRemarkPlugin.ts` to experiment with your own
transformations.

NOTE: Because this plugin runs during the MDX compilation step, you can safely use it across docs,
blog posts, and standalone pages.

# Getting Started

This example site uses the starter plugin directly from the monorepo. Visit `/starter` to
see the example route, global data, and theme component shipped by the template.

NOTE: open `examples/docusaurus-v3/docusaurus.config.js` to see how the example registers the
plugin and the accompanying remark plugin. The remark plugin rewrites this NOTE marker into a
callout so you can verify it is running.

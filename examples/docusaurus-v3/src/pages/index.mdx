# docusaurus-plugin-starter

This site demonstrates the starter template in a real Docusaurus project. Explore the docs and
example route to see how the pieces fit together.

## What's included

- A fully typed plugin entry point (`src/plugin.ts`)
- A client module that runs on every route change (`src/client/index.ts`)
- A theme component (`src/theme/StarterMessage`) that consumes plugin data
- A tiny remark plugin (`src/remark/starterRemarkPlugin.ts`) wired up in the example site's config

## Try it out

1. Run `npm install` in the repository root.
2. From this directory, start the example site:

   ```bash
   npm run example:start
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/starter` to see the sample route added by the plugin.

4. Edit files under `src/` and the example site will hot-reload so you can iterate quickly.

## Make it yours

The template is purposefully lightweight – delete the example code and replace it with the
features you need. Keep the lifecycle hooks you find useful and remove the rest.
